## Massive Online Open Courses

### Stanford University - Computer Security
> In this class you will learn how to design secure systems and write secure code. You will learn how to find vulnerabilities in code and how to design software 
> systems that limit the impact of security vulnerabilities. We will focus on principles for building secure systems and give many real world examples.

>   [Stanford University - Computer Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/security)

### Stanford University - Cryptography I
> This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange. Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.

### University of Maryland - Cryptography
> This course will introduce you to the foundations of modern cryptography, with an eye toward practical applications. We will learn the importance of carefully defining security; of relying on a set of well-studied “hardness assumptions” (e.g., the hardness of factoring large numbers); and of the possibility of proving security of complicated constructions based on low-level primitives. We will not only cover these ideas in theory, but will also explore their real-world impact. You will learn about cryptographic primitives in wide use today, and see how these can be combined to develop modern protocols for secure communication.

### Florida State University’s - Offensive Computer Security
> The primary incentive for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability, or series of vulnerabilities is to achieve a return on an investment (his/her time usually). This return need not be strictly monetary, an attacker may be interested in obtaining access to data, identities, or some other commodity that is valuable to them. The field of penetration testing involves authorized auditing and exploitation of systems to assess actual system security in order to protect against attackers. This requires thorough knowledge of vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. Thus, this course provides an introductory but comprehensive coverage of the fundamental methodologies, skills, legal issues, and tools used in white hat penetration testing and secure system administration.

### Florida State University’s - Offensive Network Security
> This class allows students to look deep into know protocols (i.e. IP, TCP, UDP) to see how an attacker can utilize these protocols to their advantage and how to spot issues in a network via captured network traffic. The first half of this course focuses on know protocols while the second half of the class focuses on reverse engineering unknown protocols. This class will utilize captured traffic to allow students to reverse the protocol by using known techniques such as incorporating bioinformatics introduced by Marshall Beddoe. This class will also cover fuzzing protocols to see if the server or client have vulnerabilities. Overall, a student finishing this class will have a better understanding of the network layers, protocols, and network communication and their interaction in computer networks.
